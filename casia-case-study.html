          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            CASIA is a sophisticated, yet easy-to-use simple workflow application enabling the user to effectively design and evaluate fit-for-purpose well architectures. It is simply a well
            data record management tool. The target audiences are engineers, managers, subsurface engineers, and people in the engineering industry.

          <h4 class="block-text-title">Design Challenge</h4>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            The organization's website needed to be designed to better connect with its audiences (mostly engineers) including building an intuitive information architecture and developing a
            coherent visual language. My task was to work on an effective website that would transfer the company’s values and product benefits to the customers and help them take advantage
            of the offered services flawlessly.

        </div>
        <div class="block-text">
          <h4 class="block-text-title">My Role</h4>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            I worked solely on the marketing website design from research to conception and visualization. I was also responsible for the front-end static coding. I worked closely with a
            product manager and one core front-end developer to build the marketing site that was not only aesthetically pleasing but also feasible with our tight deadlines.

            <li>Product Manager Interview</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            In order to build a better understanding of the product, I conducted a one-on-one interview with the product manager that had previously worked on the web application. This
            helped establish the foundations for the project by providing valuable insights that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. I couldn’t conduct a user interview because of the
            time constraint but through the lens of the product manager, I was able to see the needs of users which helped in the alignment of the business and users' goals.

              <li>What should this marketing website accomplish for the business?</li>
              <li>Who are the users? How would you describe the customers? How might we provide an experience that is engaging and valuable to the users?</li>

              <li>Increment in conversion and retention rate.</li>

          </ol>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            An extensive competitor analysis was conducted with both organizations directly related to CASIA's business model as well as indirect competitors. I audited the information
            architecture, layout, tone, and navigation of these platforms.

          <h4 class="block-text-title">Develop</h4>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            With the research phase completed, I started brainstorming ideas. This was an opportunity to ideate on different ideas and concepts based on the product requirements.

          <ol>
            <li>Userflow</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            User flow is the path taken by a prototypical user on a website or app to complete a task. The user flow takes them from their entry point through a set of steps towards a
            successful outcome and final action. I started sketching out the user flow to help the team imagine how a user would navigate the website. It will also assist us in determining
            what the final goal is when a user is on the site. One of the challenges was identifying a final goal for a user as the website is content-heavy. In the end, we determined that
            the goal for each user is to land on either the Contact Us page (inspire visitors to reach out and connect) or click on the Access demo account button.

            <li>Prototyping & Usability Testing</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">Several rounds of usability testing were undertaken at three different stages of the design process including.</p>
          <div>
            <ul class="custom-mt-md">
              <li><span class="fw6">Paper prototype</span> which moved through a number of iterations.</li>
              <li><span class="fw6">Low-fidelity prototype</span> that allowed us to take on board significant feedback.</li>
              <li><span class="fw6">High-fidelity prototype</span> incorporating the desired imagery and content.</li>
            </ul>

          <div>
            <p class="fw5 block-text-subtext">Paper prototype</p>
            <p>
              With the paper prototype, the general structure of the website could easily be tested in usability tests. Without much effort, adjustments could be made before going into the
              much more costly digital implementation.

            <li>
              A statistic section was initially created on the why us page, a trusted partner section was later introduced after talking with the client. This promotes higher trust when
              users land on the page.
            </li>
            <li>An all black theme was the design direction at first but to be able to properly show the content and product, we opted for a mix of black and white.</li>

          <h4 class="block-text-title">Conclusion</h4>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            Due to the constant feedback with the product manager, after the workshops hardly were any revisions required, neither in information architecture nor in visual design. Creating
            more design exploration for the testimonial section of the homepage would be something that I would have loved to work on more if I had more time.
