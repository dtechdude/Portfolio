          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            Yemisi Shyllon Museum of art is one of the six participants in the museum features Africa programme, a pan-african project for the conceptual development of museums on the
            African continent supported by Goethe-Institute.

          <h4 class="block-text-title">Design Challenge</h4>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            The project consists of the creation of a digital resource that will allow audiences unable to visit the museum physically to access some of the most relevant works in the
            museum. The primary target audience of the project are young people that have little knowledge of art. The project web page will highlight 30 especially important works and will
            offer high-resolution images, metadata, essays, podcasts, and short video clips on each of the 30 works. This was an attempt to immerse young audiences in a 360-degree view of
            art.

          <h4 class="block-text-title">My Role</h4>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            I worked as the sole product designer on the team to collaborate with developers to build out the YSMA microsite. This project consisted of researching, designing, prototyping,
            and some front-end coding in order to create the microsite. Building this product stretched me to work as a team with the developers and product owners.

          <h4 class="block-text-title">Research</h4>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            To kick things off, I made an effort to speak to a number of young people to gain an understanding of the reason why most of them are not interested in Art or going to the museum
            and also to see how we might be able to bridge the gap, get them excited about beautiful works of art.

          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            To identify the patterns, pain points, and needs across the interviews done, I pulled out insights from my research notes with the help of user personas. Personas help to make
            the end-user, customer, or target market a bit more real to me as a designer. it helps to keep my users at heart with every design decision I make.

          <h4 class="block-text-title">Develop</h4>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            With the research phase completed, I started brainstorming ideas. This was an opportunity to ideate on different ideas and concepts based on the product requirements.

            <li>Userflow</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            User flow is the path taken by a prototypical user on a website or app to complete a task. The user flow takes them from their entry point through a set of steps towards a
            successful outcome and final action, such as purchasing a product. I started sketching out the user flow to help us imagine how a user would navigate the website. It was
            paramount that the user was able to access all the features of the microsite on one page.

          <h4 class="block-text-title">Conclusion</h4>
          <h5 class="block-text-subtitle">What I would do differently</h5>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            One of the main things that I would change early on would be to ask more questions during product meetings. Not only to get a better sense of the product roadmap, product scope,
            and roadblocks along the way. But rather, to get a better sense of where to put the most amount of my efforts. What I learned from being the only designer and working on the
            platforms is that sacrifices need to be made and when the tough decisions come up, they need to be backed with rational reasoning. Asking the right questions is a perfect example
            of how to get to the root of a challenge and reverse engineering a viable solution based on time and scope.
