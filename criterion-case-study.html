          <h4 class="block-text-title">Design Challenge</h4>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            The challenge was to develop an application where users can browse through different categories of books and get to read them on the same platform. In addition, find ways to
            create a great user experience in discovering, searching, and reading books. Apart from designing the application, I was also tasked with the design and static development of the
            CMS content management system. This is used to manage the creation and modification of digital content/book on the Criterion ebook store.

            I reviewed our competitor’s overall app store ratings such as looking at the total number of downloads, user reviews and determining which features make them unique. These are
            the analysis I pulled from some digital ebook stores considering these are the common apps used by our potential users.

            In this stage of the design process, I decided to take out the learnings from the competitive analysis and I did the feature prioritization, classifying them into the high-impact

            <li>Paper prototype</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            With low-fidelity paper prototypes, the general structure of the application could easily be tested in usability tests. Without much effort, adjustments could be made before
            going into the much more costly digital implementation.

            After some paper prototyping adjustments, high-fidelity prototypes were created, which I supplemented with clickability using Figma. Again, user tests with the product manager
            revealed small vulnerabilities in the structure of the user interface which led to further improvements.

          <p class="block-text-paragraph">
            We moved fast. As the only designer on the project, I touched everything from app design to coding. Designing for so many screens successfully required a lot of attention to
            detail while keeping a very high level of communication throughout the entire design and development sprint. Each morning the entire team would do a stand-up, where we all synced
            on our tasks for the day and updates on our goals for the week. one of the best things that we did was to test the product internally. Doing so helped to identify the pain points
            of the app and quickly iterate based on employee feedback.
